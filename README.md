In order to use the section, clone the repository or download the .zip file <br>
1 - Once cloned or downloaded, rename the folder to "buho-code"<br>
2 - Then enter the root of your locale where the whmcs is hosting and enter this path: whmcs/templates/lagom2/core/cms/sections/config and add the folder.<br>
3 - Please note, that if you implement HTML changes to the smarty file of specific section type, which is already used in pages generated by Lagom Website Builder, then you have to clear the "Section Cache". If you won't do this your changes won't be visible on pages, where this section type has been used.<br>
4 - With this it should work correctly.
5- 
Unzip the code_mirror.zip file, once unzipped, take the code_mirror.php file and place it in the following path, includes/hooks, once added to that path, delete the compressed and unzipped folders.
